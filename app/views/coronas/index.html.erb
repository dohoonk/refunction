                      We are increasing cleaning and sanitization procedures throughout our clinics, including disinfecting commonly touched surfaces (door handles, treatment beds, and equipment used in treatments and assessments).

                    <p>
                     Clinicians and staff will be washing their hands before and after each appointment where direct contact with clients is necessary. We ask our clients to do the same.

                    </p>
                      We have directed staff to stay home if they are feeling unwell and to only return when they are completely symptom free.

                    </p>
                     We have implemented screening procedures for all clients attending treatments or assessments to minimize high risk exposures.
