                  We believe that the individuals we assess have specific functional demands that are unique and complex, and we have lengthy evaluations to understand their level of functioning and the durability of such over a full work day. Our FCE’s are typically 1 or 2 days duration, from 6 to 8 hours on the first day, and 3 to 8 hours on the second day.

                  <br>
                  Our clinicians are Matheson trained evaluators, and use a combination of standardized tests and work simulation activities to determine the individual’s current physical and cognitive abilities and limitations.
