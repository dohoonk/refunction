            Assessment and treatment sessions are of at least 30 minute durations to allow the treating therapist to ensure the client has maximum benefit for recovery during his or her visit. Private treatment rooms and spacious gymnasiums allow for optimal impairment recovery through a combination of treatment and targeted exercise prescription.
            <br>
            <br>
            The goal of all clientâ€™s treatment experience is to have them habituating to exercise by participating in kinesiology supervised exercises during each treatment session. This well researched approach allows clients to turn therapeutic corners.
