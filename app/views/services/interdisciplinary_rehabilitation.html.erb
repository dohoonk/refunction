            This assessment involves a functional testing screen conducted by an Occupational Therapist, a physical impairment assessment conducted by a Physical Therapist, and a psychological impairment screen conducted by a Psychologist.  An interdisciplinary report is generated to provide current impairment and functional status, identify functional gaps as they relate to a job target, and outline a rehabilitation plan to move the client forward towards a return to work endeavour.
